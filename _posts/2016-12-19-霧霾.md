Numerous scientific studies connect particle pollution exposure to a variety of health issues, including:

    irritation of the eyes, nose and throat
    coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath
    reduced lung function
    irregular heartbeat
    asthma attacks
    heart attacks
    premature death in people with heart or lung disease
